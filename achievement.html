                <h3>Diploma in Management [1999-2003]</h3>
                <p>
                    During my father's service in the Royal Malaysia Police, he was offered the opportunity to pursue a Diploma. 
                    He accepted the offer and enrolled in a Diploma in Management course. 
                    At that time, my father pursued his studies through distance learning. 
                    Eventually, he completed his Diploma and graduated in 2003.

                <h3>Promotion Offer by Appointment (KPSL) [2016] </h3>
                <p>
                    In 2016, my father was promoted by appointment from Corporal to Sergeant. 
                    At that time, I felt proud of my father's achievement. 
                    To this day, he still holds the rank of Sergeant, and I hope he will be promoted to Sergeant Major.

                    In 2022, I achieved a significant milestone by scoring 6As in the SPM examination. 
                    Initially, I was not confident in myself and did not expect to achieve such excellent and meaningful results.

                <p>
                    From November 19-22 2024, I participated in the Basic Course for the General Operations Force (PGA) at the Police Training Centre in Kuching. 
                    I learned a lot about the General Operations Force (PGA) and experienced a bit of 'Para Military' training within the Royal Malaysia Police.
